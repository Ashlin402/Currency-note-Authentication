# Currency-note-Authentication
This project authenticates currency notes using image processing and feature matching with ORB in OpenCV.

## Purpose and Application:
To verify the authenticity of currency notes using image processing and feature matching techniques. This can be used in banks, shops, and ATMs to detect counterfeit currency.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Google Colab (for prototyping)

## How It Works
1. Upload an authentic note and a test note.
2. Extract key features using ORB.
3. Match features with BFMatcher.
4. Authenticate based on the number of matching features.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run main.py and upload the note images.

##Conclusion
A lightweight and effective way to detect fake currency using computer vision.
